# 6 – Delete events

Related issue(s): GH-6
Source of truth for task status: the external issue tracker.

---

## Task Summary

Add ability to delete events via context menu button and Delete key.

---

## Current Understanding

Two deletion methods:
1. Delete button at bottom of context menu - deletes targeted events
2. Delete/Backspace key - deletes currently selected events

---

## What We Need to Do

**Completed:**
1. ~~Create `delete-events!` function~~
2. ~~Add Delete button to context menu~~
3. ~~Add keydown listener for Delete/Backspace key~~
4. ~~Clear selection after deletion~~

---

## Important Learnings

* Use `keep-indexed` with a set of indices to filter events efficiently
* Selection must be cleared after deletion since indices become invalid
* Both Delete and Backspace keys work for deletion

---

## Important Files / Components

* `src/app/app.cljs`:
  * `delete-events!` - removes events by indices, clears selection
  * `on-keydown` - handles Delete/Backspace key
  * `color-menu` - includes Delete button at bottom

## Reasoning Notes

Initial document creation for task 6.

Implementation complete. Delete works via context menu and keyboard.
