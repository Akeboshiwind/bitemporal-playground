## Task Summary

Integrate bitemporal-playground into the blog following the same pattern used for christmas-talk, but placing it under "tools" instead of "talks". The app should be linked from the tools page and open as a standalone webapp (not embedded).

---

## Current Understanding

The integration pattern involves:
1. Source repo builds to `target/public/` with `--base-path` set to final URL path
2. GitHub Actions pushes built artifacts to a `dist` branch
3. Blog repo includes `dist` branch as a git submodule
4. Blog's CI/CD copies submodule contents to `static/` directory
5. Hugo builds and deploys, making the app available at the specified path

The bitemporal-playground will be available at `/tools/bitemporal/` on the blog.

## What We Need to Do

All file changes are complete. To finish deployment:

1. **In bitemporal-playground repo:**
   - Set up git remote: `git remote add origin git@github.com:Akeboshiwind/bitemporal-playground.git`
   - Commit and push changes to main
   - Wait for GitHub Actions to build and push to `dist` branch

2. **In blog repo:**
   - Initialize the submodule: `git submodule add -b dist git@github.com:Akeboshiwind/bitemporal-playground.git tools/bitemporal-playground`
   - Commit all changes
   - Push to trigger blog rebuild

---

## Important Learnings

- The christmas-talk pattern uses `--base-path` in build.js to rewrite HTML asset paths
- Submodules must point to the `dist` branch (built artifacts only)
- The blog's hugo.yml copies submodule contents to `static/` which Hugo serves directly
- `force_orphan: true` keeps the dist branch clean with only the latest build

---

## Important Files / Components

**bitemporal-playground repo:**
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` – Updated to use `--base-path /tools/bitemporal`
- `src/index.html` – Updated title to "Bitemporal Visualizer"
- `build.js` – Already supported `--base-path` argument

**blog repo:**
- `.gitmodules` – Added bitemporal-playground submodule entry
- `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` – Added step to copy bitemporal-playground to static/tools/bitemporal/
- `layouts/tools/link.html` – New layout for tools that redirect to external/static URLs
- `content/tools/bitemporal.md` – Content page that uses link layout to redirect to /tools/bitemporal/

---

## Reasoning Notes

Followed the established christmas-talk integration pattern exactly, only changing the destination path from `/talk/christmas` to `/tools/bitemporal` to match the user's request for placing it under "tools".
