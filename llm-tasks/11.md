## Task Summary

Add tick marks to both axes labeled t0, t1, t2, ... t10 corresponding to grid lines. Include a room-synced option to toggle ticks on/off.

---

## Current Understanding

- Grid has 10 divisions (0.0 to 1.0 in 0.1 increments)
- Ticks should appear on both X axis (Valid Time) and Y axis (System Time)
- Labels: t0, t1, t2, ... t10
- Setting should be room-synced like snap-to-grid

---

## What We Need to Do

1. Add `show-ticks` to state, default-settings, persistence
2. Add to room sync (broadcast-state!, handle-room-message, sync watch)
3. Add `draw-ticks!` function in canvas.cljs
4. Pass `show-ticks` to render-canvas! and call draw-ticks!
5. Add toggle function and checkbox in Room Settings section

## Important Files / Components

* `src/app/app.cljs` – State, persistence, room sync, sidebar UI
* `src/app/canvas.cljs` – Canvas rendering, tick drawing

---

## Reasoning Notes

Following the same pattern as snap-to-grid for room sync.

Implementation complete:
- Added `show-ticks` to state with default `true`
- Room sync uses camelCase `showTicks` for JS interop
- Ticks drawn with 6px marks and t0-t10 labels on both axes
- Added "Axis ticks" checkbox in Room Settings section with sync icon
