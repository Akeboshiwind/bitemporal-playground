## Task Summary

Strip back the Christmas presentation app content, leaving only the useful core infrastructure for building static frontend-only webapps with Squint (ClojureScript), Bun, Tailwind CSS, Reagami, and Ably.

---

## Current Understanding

Task complete. The repo has been stripped to a minimal starter with:
- Squint compilation pipeline
- Bun bundling with Tailwind
- Babashka task definitions
- GitHub Actions build/deploy workflow
- Reagami for UI rendering
- Ably real-time with presence counter demo

---

## What We Need to Do

- [x] Create task file
- [x] Remove presentation-specific source files
- [x] Create minimal app.cljs starter
- [x] Restore original ably.cljs wrapper
- [x] Update build.js (remove asset copying)
- [x] Update squint.edn paths
- [x] Update package.json (kept ably, removed qrcode)
- [x] Update README.md for generic starter
- [x] Update index.html
- [x] Update GitHub workflow
- [x] Add presence counter demo
- [x] Add connection status pill
- [x] Verify build works

---

## Important Learnings

- The build pipeline is: Squint compiles .cljs → build/ → Bun bundles to target/public/
- bb.edn tasks are generic and work regardless of source paths (configured in squint.edn)
- build.js handles Tailwind via bun-plugin-tailwind
- Ably state atom needs to be watched for re-renders on connection status changes

---

## Important Files / Components

- `src/app/app.cljs` – Main app with presence counter and connection status UI
- `src/app/ably.cljs` – Ably wrapper (presence, pub/sub, connection management)
- `bb.edn` – Babashka task definitions
- `squint.edn` – Squint compiler config
- `build.js` – Bun build script
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` – CI/CD workflow

---

## Reasoning Notes

Task complete. Stripped presentation-specific content while keeping Ably integration per user request. Added presence counter and connection status indicator as a working demo.
